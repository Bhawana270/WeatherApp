# Weather App

A simple, client-side weather-checking application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays current conditions in a clean, user-friendly interface.

---

## Overview

This app allows users to enter a **city name** or **location** to view current weather conditions such as:
- Temperature (in Celsius)
- Weather type/description (e.g., clear sky, rain)
- An icon representing the weather

If no valid input is provided, or the API request fails, fallback demo weather data is displayed so the app still functions.
---

## Features

- Input either **City** or **Location**
- Real-time weather data using **OpenWeatherMap API**
- Weather icon, description, and temperature display
- **Graceful fallback** with sample data if API fails
- Clean, minimal UI (customizable with CSS)
